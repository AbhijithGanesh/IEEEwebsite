            Our Vision We think slightly out of the box, we believe that a
            clubâ€™s resources must not only be channeled into conducting events
            but also to propagate learning and teaching, symbiotically.

            That said, we conduct two flagship events, namely, HackHub and
            Paradox, and tons of insightful workshops!
