It provided a gigantic platform to lock horns with the greatest minds from all over the city. The competition had a massive cash prize prize pool of 1,00,000/- INR. There were a plethora of domains to test the participantâ€™s brains and wits like Robotics,

Internet of Things, Embedded System, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It was held from 29/03/2019 to 30/03/2019. HackHub was entirely sponsored by Euro Exim Bank.</p>

                        <p className="text-left text-lg">Air conduction refers to sound from the outside carried by air waves from the outer ear and transferred to electrical waves in the inner ear. Bone conduction refers to sound conducted as subtle vibration along the bones to the inner ear housing the organs of hearing and balance. The sound vibration actually activates both the sense of hearing and the organ of balance. The vibration, in fact, is carried through the entire skeletal structure. We are working on a device which can facilitate this by using transducers.PARADOX was a two day online cryptic hunt organised by IEEE Computer Society of VIT Chennai. The 2021 edition of PARADOX will be held from 10 April 2021 12:00 AM IST to 11 April 2021 11:59 PM IST. The hunt consists of several questions in form of pictures and players would require to rack their brains to solve them and reach to an answer.

The goal of players should be to find the answer as fast as possible to stay on top of the leaderboard. At the end of two days the player at the top of leaderboard will be declared as the winner of PARADOX 2021.</p>

In any front end application, the main goal is to make the user experience feel natural and intuitive. Since our application will be displayed around campus televisions we came up with a touchless interface. We use machine learning for gesture controls to control the interface without using touch. The interface is deployed on arm devices locally which are synchronized through cloud.</p>
